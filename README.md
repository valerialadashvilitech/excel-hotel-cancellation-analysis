## Project Overview
This two-part Excel project (part of Codecademy’s “Excel for Data Analysis” course) analyzes a real-world hotel booking dataset (~119,000 reservations, 2015–2017).
The primary goal was to identify cancellation drivers, evaluate risk factors (lead time, seasonality, distribution channel, hotel type), and provide actionable recommendations to reduce cancellations and optimize revenue management.

## Files
- **handling-hotel-data-project.xlsx**: Data cleaning, outlier handling, pivot tables for seasonal cancellation rates, special request revenue analysis and protection.
- **visualizing-hotel-data.xlsx**: Advanced visualizations (heatmaps, sparklines, charts) exploring lead time, seasonality, and channel patterns.

## Tools Used
Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets 
- Pivot Tables
- Conditional Formatting & Heatmaps
- Sparklines & Trend Lines
- Charts (bar, stacked)
- Text Functions (TRIM, parsing)
- Outlier Handling & Sheet Protection
- Data Binning & Percentage Calculations

## Key Findings
- Lead Time Risk: Long lead time bookings show significantly higher cancellation rates; the distribution is heavily right-skewed (most bookings are short-notice).
- Seasonality Peaks: Both volume and cancellations spike in summer (June–August), especially for long-lead bookings; city hotels reach ~40–41% cancellation rates vs. ~10% for resort hotels.
- Channel Differences: Agent channel dominates volume but has the longest average lead time (104 days) and highest proportion of long-lead bookings (46%); Corporate/Direct channels are shorter and more reliable.
- Special Requests: Bookings with multiple special requests correlate with higher retention and revenue (~$20 average revenue per request, 2015–2017).
- Strategic Verdict: Targeted policies (short-lead incentives, flexible cancellations for high-risk segments) can meaningfully reduce cancellations and improve occupancy predictability.
